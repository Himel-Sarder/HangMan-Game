# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman game! This is a simple text-based implementation of the classic word-guessing game. The objective of the game is to guess the hidden word before the hangman is fully drawn.

## How to Play

1. Run the `hangman.py` file using Python.
2. You will be presented with a welcome message and a blank space representing the hidden word.
3. Enter a letter to guess. If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word. If it's incorrect, a part of the hangman will be drawn.
4. Keep guessing letters until you either complete the word or the hangman is fully drawn.
5. If you complete the word before the hangman is fully drawn, you win! Otherwise, you lose.

## Files

- `hangman.py`: This is the main Python script for the Hangman game.
- ``: This file contains a list of words that can be used as the hidden word for the game.

## Usage

To play the game, simply run the `hangman.py` script in your Python environment. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.

```bash
python hangman.py
```
